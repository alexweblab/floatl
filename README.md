## Installation

Floatl is built primarily for module bundlers such as [Browserify](http://browserify.org) and [webpack](http://webpack.github.io).
As such it is distributed via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/floatl).

```bash
yarn add floatl # or npm i -S floatl
```

_An UMD build is available from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/richardvenneman/floatl/releases) if you're not using a module bundler. This version adds `Floatl` to the global namespace._

### Styling

Add the required styling to your app. Please refer to the [GitHub wiki page on styling](https://github.com/richardvenneman/floatl/wiki/Styling) for more information.

## Usage

*NOTE: Check the [GitHub wiki page](https://github.com/richardvenneman/floatl/wiki) for instructions on how to use with React & Angular.*

Markup your `label` and `input` (or `textarea`) with the floatl classes and wrap them in an element with the `floatl` class:

```html
<div class="floatl">
  <label for="first_name" class="floatl__label">First name</label>
  <input name="first_name" class="floatl__input" placeholder="First name" type="text" />
</div>
```

Instantiate Floatl by passing in the wrapping DOM element:

```javascript
import Floatl from "floatl";

var element = document.getElementById("my-floatl-element");
new Floatl(element);
```

### Destroying instances

If you keep a reference to your Floatl instance, it's easy to remove all of the event handlers by calling the `destroy` instance method:

```javascript
var myFloatl = new Floatl(element);
myFloatl.destroy()
```

## Placeholder polyfilling

While the JavaScript supports IE8+, Floatl aims to be good at Floating Labels and only that. The Floating Labels Pattern works best with placeholders and it is therefor recommended to install legacy browser placeholder support should you need it, for example [Placekeeper](https://github.com/kristerkari/placekeeper) or [Placeholders.js](https://github.com/jamesallardice/Placeholders.js).

## Motivations

There are several libraries available that implement the Float Label Pattern, most notably [floatlabels.js](https://github.com/clubdesign/floatlabels.js) and [FloatLabel.js](https://github.com/m10l/FloatLabel.js). However, these libraries did not quite fulfill the requisites I had in mind (see features above) and I did not find any Bower compatible libraries when I started this project. Furthermore I like to use a well-maintained library. Since we're using this library in production at [CitySpotters](https://www.cityspotters.com) I'm keeping this library up to date.

## Contributing

Everyone is encouraged to help improve this project. Here are a few ways you can help:

* Report bugs
* Fix bugs and submit pull requests
* Write, clarify, or fix documentation
* Suggest or add new features

## Development & testing

This project uses [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io) with the [Karma Test Runner](http://karma-runner.github.io/).

* Install dependencies with `yarn install`
* Run the test suite with: `yarn test` (or `yarn run tdd` for Test Driven Development)
