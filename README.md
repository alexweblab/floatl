## Installation

Floatl is built primarily for module bundlers such as [Browserify](http://browserify.org) and [webpack](http://webpack.github.io).
As such it is distributed via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/floatl).

```bash
yarn add floatl

# or

npm i -S floatl
```

## Using the global Floatl (classic browser environment)

If you're not using a module bundler, you can download the globally built UMD version from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/richardvenneman/floatl/releases) and include it in your app.
This adds `Floatl` to the global namespace.

## Usage

NOTE: Check the [GitHub wiki page](https://github.com/richardvenneman/floatl/wiki) for instructions on how to use with React & Angular.

Markup your `label` and `input` (or `textarea`) with the floatl classes and wrap them in an element with the `floatl` class:

```html
<div class="floatl">
  <label for="first_name" class="floatl__label">First name</label>
  <input name="first_name" class="floatl__input" placeholder="First name" type="text" />
</div>
```

Instantiate Floatl by passing in the wrapping DOM element:

```javascript
var element = document.getElementById("my-floatl-element");

// Module approach
import { Floatl } from "floatl";
const floatl = new Floatl(element);

// When using the global Floatl
new Floatl(element);
```

### Initializing multiple Floatls

Initializing all of the Floatl inputs on your page can be easily done like this:

```javascript
var elements = document.getElementsByClassName("floatl");

for (var element of elements) {
  new Floatl(element);
}
```

### CSS styling

All functionality and styling is basically achieved by toggling CSS classes. Because of this it is easy to apply your own styling. Check out this [Gist with example styling](https://gist.github.com/richardvenneman/cf64188aa645208c65c8) to get an idea.

## Browser support

While the JavaScript supports IE8+, Floatl aims to be good at Floating Labels and only that. The Floating Labels Pattern works best with placeholders and it is therefor recommended to install legacy browser placeholder support should you need it, for example [Placekeeper](https://github.com/kristerkari/placekeeper) or [Placeholders.js](https://github.com/jamesallardice/Placeholders.js).

## Motivations

There are several libraries available that implement the Float Label Pattern, most notably [floatlabels.js](https://github.com/clubdesign/floatlabels.js) and [FloatLabel.js](https://github.com/m10l/FloatLabel.js). However, these libraries did not quite fulfill the requisites I had in mind (see features above) and I did not find any Bower compatible libraries when I started this project. Furthermore I like to use a well-maintained library. Since we're using this library in production at [Cityspotters](https://www.cityspotters.com) I'm keeping this library up to date.

## Contributing

Everyone is encouraged to help improve this project. Here are a few ways you can help:

* Report bugs
* Fix bugs and submit pull requests
* Write, clarify, or fix documentation

## Development & testing

This project uses [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io) with the [Karma Test Runner](http://karma-runner.github.io/).

* Install dependencies with `yarn install`
* Run the test suite with: `yarn test` (or `yarn run tdd` for Test Driven Development)
